        <h2>About Cameras</h2><br>
        <p>A<strong> digital camera</strong> is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory. Most cameras
            produced today are
            digital, largely replacing those that capture images on photographic film. Digital cameras are now widely
            incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of
            dedicated cameras (which are still avaliable). High-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still
            commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher-quality photographs.</p>
